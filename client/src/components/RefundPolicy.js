You can find an overview of our policies here. All policies, and additional terms posted on and in our Services are incorporated into this User Agreement. You agree to comply with all terms of this User Agreement when accessing or using our Services.

                  Please be advised that this User Agreement contains provisions that govern how claims you and we have against each other are resolved (see "Disclaimer of Warranties; Limitation of Liability" and "Legal Disputes" provisions below). It also contains an Agreement to Arbitrate which will, with limited exception, require you to submit claims you have against us or our agents to binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate (see Legal Disputes, Section B ("Agreement to Arbitrate")).

                <h1 class="text-2xl mt-6 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-800">Policy Enforcement</h1>
                <div>When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance history and the specific circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers. The foregoing does not limit or impair our right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone, or to terminate this agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion.</div>

                <h1 class="text-2xl mt-6 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-800">Fees and Taxes</h1>
                <div>We charge sellers for the use of our Services. In some cases, where buyers receive supplemental Services such as authentication or storage Services for items in certain categories, we may also charge those buyers for such supplemental Services.

                  The fees we charge sellers for using our Services to sell goods and services are listed on our Selling fees pages. We may change our selling fees from time to time by posting the changes on the Ceylonese site fourteen (14) days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or any changes that result in the reduction of fees.
                 
                  If you are a seller, you are liable for fees arising out of all sales made using some or all of our Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of Ceylonese. In particular, if you offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context of buying or selling outside of Ceylonese, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item, even if the item doesn't sell, given your usage of our Services for the introduction to a buyer.</div>

                <h1 class="text-2xl mt-6 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-800">Listing Conditions</h1>
                <div>
                  You will not sell and will promptly remove all listings for any product recalled by a manufacturer or governmental agency if the sale of the product is prohibited by law or regulation or the product poses a health or safety hazard as specified by any governmental agency. Ceylonese has no responsibility or liability for the safety or performance of any product that you list or sell using our Services, including any product that is subject to a recall. You are solely responsible for any non-conformity or defect in, or compliance with any public or private recall of any product you list or sell using our Services<br/>
                  Ceylonese may publish and promote your listings, including related content such as username, product reviews and feedback on the websites or in the applications, services, and tools of other Ceylonese Inc. corporate family members or cooperating third-party operators of websites, applications, services, and tools<br/>
                  Selling fees do not purchase exclusive rights to item exposure on our Services. We may display third-party advertisements (including links and references thereto) or other content in any part of our Services, including listings, in our sole discretion and without consent from, or payment, fee reduction, or other credit to, sellers<br/>
                </div>

                <h1 class="text-2xl mt-6 font-semibold text-gray-800 dark:text-gray-800">Returns and cancellations</h1>
                <div>Buyers generally do not have the right to cancel an order. Buyers can request to cancel an order on Ceylonese within the time period and as provided in our Order cancellation policy, and the seller will have 3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order cannot be canceled, buyers may still be permitted to return the item if the item isâ€¯eligible for return.

                  In certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an item returned to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the buyer may elect to use an Ceylonese-generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label directly from a carrier. By choosing to use an Ceylonese-generated shipping label, you (as a buyer) agree that Ceylonese may deduct the cost of the shipping label from the refund owed to you<br/>.</div>
